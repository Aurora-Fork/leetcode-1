# https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/
# The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
# Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
# Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement,
# where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

# For each column, place a queen in each possible row that does not conflict with an existing queen.
# Time - O(n^2 * n!), n possible rows for first col, n-1 for second ... etc.  each result size n^2
# Space - O(n^2 * n!)
